Installation
------------

To use xtremes, in near future it will be possible to install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install xtremes

Until now, only a preliminary test version is avaiable:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ test-xtremes


The modules
-----------
So far, three modules are implemented. The module ``xtremes.miscellaneous`` contains basic functionalities, 
whereas ``xtremes.HigherOrderStatistics`` is specialized on the influence of higher order statistics for 
Maximum Likelihood estimations. ``xtremes.Bootstrap`` provides a suitable Bootstrap device
for block maxima.

For each module, there will be a tutorial and a subsection in the API reference.
